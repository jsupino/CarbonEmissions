# United States Power Plants: A Study on CO2 Emissions
By Jade Supino

An interactive dashboard focused on the analysis of the carbon dioxide emissions emitted by power plants across the United States. The data, retrieved from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, spans from 2011 to 2020.
Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas present in the atmosphere and is predominantly produced by power plants. The non-biogenic emissions emitted through power plants impacts the environment from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation. Assessing emission trends across states and facilities can help pinpoint areas for emission reduction. The dashboard integrates essential data and interactive visualizations utilizing Python and cascading style sheets (CSS). Users have the flexibility to manually select the information they wish to access through the drop-down menus, sliders, and a play button. The aim of providing this information is to support the development of cleaner and more sustainable power plants in high producing areas.

Ensure all required Python libraries and packages:
    pip install numpy
    pip install pandas
    pip install plotly
    pip install dash


These will be required for the analysis. To run the code, download all the necessary datasets and files. Open an integrated development environment, such as Visual Studio Code, and load the files. Run the python file named "main" which contains the Dash application. Upon running the file, in terminal, ctrl+click the link provided. The application with open in your local web browser. The dashboard will be presented and the user can interact with the drop-downs, sliders, and play button to return results. To exit the application, go to terminal and click ctrl+C.
